# Data-Viz-Using-ggplot2
This repository contains the data and code used for a guest lecture on data visualization using ggplot2 in R. The guest lecture was given for Dr. Thea Knowles' class CSD 491: Special Topics: Data Analytics in Communication Sciences and Disorders at Michigan State University. This lecture will be given on Wednesday, April 19, 2023. This Github repo will also be connected to a project page on OSF that also contains my slides and additional resources.
